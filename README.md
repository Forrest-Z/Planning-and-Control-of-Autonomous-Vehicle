# Develop Autonomous Driving Planning and Control algorithms based on ROS

**Developed and optimized planning module algorithms for autonomous driving, including global reference line computations and local path planning using Frenet sampling, polynomial fitting, and collision detection.**

**Designed and implemented multiple control systems (PID, LQR, MPC) to improve vehicle trajectory tracking and adaptive cruise control, enhancing vehicle response and safety.**

**Applied advanced pathfinding methods such as Hybird A star for motion planning in dynamic and complex environments,ensuring the algorithms perform effectively in simulated scenarios.**

**Verified the reliability and efficacy of autonomous control algorithms through experiments on scaled F1/10 model race cars, ensuring robust performance in live racing environments.**
